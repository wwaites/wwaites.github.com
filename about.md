This site contains some various writings on music and bagpipes and
such by [William Waites]. I have been playing the [Highland Bagpipe]
since I was twelve years old though my main instrument nowadays is a
stand of [Border Pipes] made by [Nigel Richard]. I had my first
lessons from Alec MacNeill at the [Black Watch Association] in
Montreal and later with Alex Orbegoso as well as some lessons with
Archie Cairns and Colin MacLellan. In the mid 1990s I met with some
success on the Ontario and Montreal competition circuit but have not
competed for the past 15 years or so. These days I often play at
sessions around town and in the West Highlands where I am fortunate
enough to have to travel to often for work.

I live in Edinburgh and am a network engineer with the [High-speed
Universal Broadband for Scotland] project at the [University of
Stirling]. I can be contacted via email at
