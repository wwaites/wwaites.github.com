title: In search of tone

A few weeks ago at the [LBPS Collogue] I was downstairs
from the main event in where [Finn Moore] was tuning up
and getting ready for his performance. I commented on 
the **big**, resonant sound he was getting out of his
border pipes. "Cane," he said. Later on, Finn was
busy and I was speaking with Hamish. I wondered if he
thought it might be possible to make up a set of cane
reeds to suit the [Nigel Richard] drones which I play.
There was a long pause. No, he said, he wasn't familiar
enough with Nigel's drones to be confident about getting
it right.

The recommended drone reeds for Nigel Richard's pipes
are [Ezeedrone] synthetic reeds. These are the ones that
will come with a new set. They sound good and are very
stable.
